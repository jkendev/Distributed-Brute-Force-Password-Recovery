# Distributed-Brute-Force-Password-Recovery
A university assignment project. Aim was to produce a password recovery program and have the brute force calculations distributed across a network.

If you want to get a broad overview of the design and rationale for this project, I recommend that you read the report ("Overview and Report.pdf"). If you read this you will better understand the code.
